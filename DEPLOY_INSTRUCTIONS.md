# HealFast Deployment Instructions

Your code is ready to push to GitHub. Since the automated push is timing out, here are manual steps:

## Option 1: Push from Terminal (Recommended)
Open a new terminal window and run:
```bash
cd /Users/dwaynemoore/Apps/heal-fast-f9850985
git push -u origin main
```

This may take a few minutes due to the repository size (34MB).

## Option 2: Use GitHub Desktop
1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Add your local repository: `/Users/dwaynemoore/Apps/heal-fast-f9850985`
3. Click "Publish repository"

## Option 3: Push in smaller chunks
```bash
# Push just the code first (without node_modules)
git push -u origin main

# If that fails, try pushing specific commits
git log --oneline  # See your commits
git push origin <commit-hash>  # Push one at a time
```
